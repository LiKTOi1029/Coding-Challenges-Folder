# Trinary Encrypter

The Trinary Encrypter is an encrypter that encrypts plain english into ascii values and then converts the ascii values into trinary values before then using an algorithm (using a special key system) to jumble up the numbers to confuse the reader.\
\
Trinary is a Base 3 number system (0, 1, 2) that I initially discovered through the esoteric language Malbolge\
\
Some examples of trinary vs binary vs ascii\
\
\#1\
ASCII: 15\
BINARY: 1111\
TRINARY: 120\
\
\#2\
ASCII: 45\
BINARY: 101101\
TRINARY: 1200\
\
\#3\
ASCII: 88\
BINARY: 1011000\
TRINARY: 10021\
\
Then, we will take the Trinary value and we'll use an algorithm accompanied by a key to encrypt it. Send the key and the result to your friends!\
\
If you wish to encrypt and decrypt right into the terminal, please use the following syntax: `TEXT KEY` else it will throw an error.

# SAS ZA Calculator

This is a script where you input the statistics of your gun and it outputs a rough estimate of how much damage the gun should do\
\
You input the damage, ammunition, rps, pierce, and optionally the damage/second (separated by a space) resulting in an input like:\
\
`100 35 15 2 115 2`\
`100` is the damage\
`35` is the ammunition\
`15` is the rps\
`2` is the pierce\
`115 2` is the damage (`155`) per second (`2`). Only use this if your weapon applies the acidic or burning effect on zombies\
\
output: ``
\
I only really use this for personal use, however you are free to use it if you'd like.

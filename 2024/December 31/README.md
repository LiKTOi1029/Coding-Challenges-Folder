# Morse Code Translator

This is a project I started in Dec 31 of 2024 and didn't do a very good job at making it so here is a second version of the same script, but better!\
\
Please input GO to translate the contents of `input.txt` and write the translated version into `output.txt`\
Input EXIT to exit the script\
You can also directly translate things by inputting any English text!\
\
Input: Hello there!\
Output: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / - .... . .-. . -.-.--\
\
In even supports punctuation on a basic level\
\
Input: Name@Email.com\
Output: -. .- -- . .--.-. . -- .- .. .-.. .-.-.- -.-. --- --\
\
**<DISCLAIMER> THIS FILE TRANSLATOR CANNOT TRANSLATE MORSE TO ENGLISH DIRECTLY FROM THE TERMINAL YET**\
On top of that it is also backwards compatible! Type morse code and get english translations! Type Morse Code into `input.txt` and input GO into the terminal to output!

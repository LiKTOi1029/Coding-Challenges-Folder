# Coding Challenges!

This is the folder that I use to store all of my coding challenges that I do.
I used to create one new repository for every single coding challenge, but somebody
much more versed told me I should condense them into one repository and they were right.
Now everything is divided by years and their specific months and dates. So, you can see
what projects I have been working on at which dates.
